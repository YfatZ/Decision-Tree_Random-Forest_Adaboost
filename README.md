This assignment was for a project in Machine Learning I had to predict a cancer class - benign or malignant.<br>
<sub>The Dataset for the assignment is included as "cancer_classification.csv" .</sub>

### The steps:
1. **Imports** -> Import relevant libraries and data sets
2. **Exploration** -> Inspecting the data and exploration data analysis
3. **Manipulation** -> Data alteration, adding/removing columns, etc.
4. **Algorithm** -> Splitting the data to train set and test set, training the algorithm.
5. **Validation** -> Checking metric accuracies on the test set.
6. **Conclusion** -> Conclusion on performance, model selection, business problem.

### Libraries that was used: 
```
1. pandas
2. numpy
3. matplotlib.pyplot
4. seaborn
```

# Enjoy! :)
